# RaceBox Mini S over Bluetooth (Delphi)

Reads a RaceBox Mini, Mini S or Micro from a Windows PC over Bluetooth LE:
live GPS/motion data at 25 Hz, and the sessions recorded on the device
(standalone recording, Mini S and Micro only). Downloaded sessions can be
saved as CSV. This is the data-capture step for later lap and track-map work,
so every reading ends up in one plain record, `TRaceBoxSample`.

It uses Delphi's own `System.Bluetooth` classes (RAD Studio 12, Windows 10 or
later). No third-party libraries, and nothing here depends on Vulkan.

## Folder layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `Source/RaceBox.Protocol.pas` | Packet framing, checksum, commands and decoders. No Bluetooth, also builds with Free Pascal. |
| `Source/RaceBox.Session.pas` | Splits a download into sessions, CSV save/load, decodes a saved raw download. No Bluetooth. |
| `Source/RaceBox.BLE.pas` | `TRaceBoxClient`: scan, connect, live data, unlock, download, erase. Delphi only. |
| `Demo/RaceBoxReader.dpr` | Small VCL app that uses all of the above. |
| `Tests/RaceBoxProtocolTest.dpr` | Console tests for the protocol and session units. |

## Using the demo

1. Open `Demo/RaceBoxReader.dpr` in RAD Studio 12 (it creates the `.dproj`), build for Win32 or Win64 and run.
2. Switch the RaceBox on. **Close the RaceBox phone app** or turn off the phone's Bluetooth: the device takes one connection at a time.
3. Press **Scan**, pick the RaceBox in the list, press **Connect**. Live data shows on the left.
4. If you set a memory security code in the RaceBox app, type it and press **Unlock** (needed after every connect).
5. **Status** shows how many records are stored. **Download** fetches all of them; a full memory (196,608 records) takes a few minutes.
6. Select sessions in the list (or none for all) and press **Save CSV...** to write one file per session.
   **Save raw...** keeps the exact bytes received; **Open file...** decodes a raw file or a CSV again without the device.

The RaceBox does not need to be paired in Windows settings first.

## Using it in your own code

```pascal
uses RaceBox.Protocol, RaceBox.Session, RaceBox.BLE;

FClient := TRaceBoxClient.Create;
FClient.OnDeviceFound := DeviceFound;      // (Index, Name, Address, Rssi)
FClient.OnConnected := Connected;
FClient.OnLiveSample := LiveSample;        // TRaceBoxSample, 25 Hz
FClient.OnDownloadComplete := DownloadDone;
FClient.StartScan;
...
FClient.Connect(Index);
FClient.Unlock(123456);                    // only if security is on
FClient.StartDownload;
...
procedure TForm1.DownloadDone(Sender: TObject; Cancelled: Boolean);
var Sessions: TRaceBoxSessionList;
begin
  Sessions := FClient.ExtractSessions;     // you own it now
  RaceBoxSaveSessionsCsv('C:\RaceBox', Sessions);
  ...
end;
```

Events run on the main thread, so you can touch the UI in them.

### `TRaceBoxSample`

| Field | Unit |
|---|---|
| `UtcTime`, `UnixTimeMs`, `TimeValid` | UTC `TDateTime`, ms since 1970 |
| `Latitude`, `Longitude` | degrees |
| `AltitudeMSL`, `AltitudeWGS` | m |
| `Speed` / `SpeedKmh` | m/s / km/h |
| `Heading` | degrees, 0 = north |
| `GForceX` / `Y` / `Z` | g (X front/back, Y right/left, Z up/down) |
| `GyroX` / `Y` / `Z` | deg/s (roll, pitch, yaw) |
| `FixStatus`, `NumSV`, `PDOP`, `HorizAccuracy` ... | fix quality |
| `HasGoodFix` | 3D fix with the valid-fix flag set; ignore positions when False |

### Sessions

The device stores everything in one memory. It writes a state-change record
when recording starts, stops, or pauses, so a new session starts at each
recording start. As a fallback, a gap of more than `MaxGapSeconds` (default
300 s) between samples also starts a new session; set it to 0 to turn that off.

### CSV columns

`utc_time, unix_ms, itow_ms, latitude, longitude, alt_msl_m, alt_wgs_m,
speed_kmh, speed_ms, heading_deg, fix, fix_ok, sats, pdop, h_acc_m, v_acc_m,
speed_acc_ms, heading_acc_deg, g_x, g_y, g_z, gyro_x_dps, gyro_y_dps,
gyro_z_dps, battery_raw, fix_flags, latlon_flags`

Decimal point is always `.`, times are UTC. `unix_ms` is the easiest column
for lining the data up with other logs (for example VCDS CSV files).

## Tests

```
cd RaceBox\Tests
dcc32 -U..\Source RaceBoxProtocolTest.dpr && RaceBoxProtocolTest
```
or with Free Pascal: `fpc -Mdelphi -Fu../Source RaceBoxProtocolTest.dpr`.
`Tests\RunTests.bat` runs the tests and also builds the demo (which compiles
`RaceBox.BLE`); the repo's Delphi CI workflow calls it.

They check every example packet in the RaceBox protocol document, the stream
parser (split and merged notifications, garbage, bad checksums), sample
decoding, session splitting and the CSV round trip.

## What has and has not been tested

- `RaceBox.Protocol` and `RaceBox.Session` were compiled and their tests pass under Free Pascal 3.2.
- `RaceBox.BLE` and the demo have **not** been compiled in Delphi or run against a real RaceBox yet.
  Expect small fixes on first build. If the scan finds nothing or connecting fails, the log at the
  bottom of the demo window shows which step stopped.
- Stopping/starting recording and erasing memory are in `TRaceBoxClient` but not in the demo,
  because erasing cannot be undone.

## Protocol source

[RaceBox BLE Protocol Documentation, revision 9](https://www.racebox.pro/products/mini-micro-protocol-documentation).
Recorded-data download needs firmware that supports standalone recording (Mini S / Micro).
